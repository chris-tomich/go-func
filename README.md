# go-func
A tool intended to be used with go generate to generate various functional features for custom types.

Further documentation is coming but if you are eager to try it, build "cmd/go_func.go" like so.

```
go build -o ~/go-workspace/bin/go-func ~/go-workspace/src/github.com/chris-tomich/go-func/cmd/go_func.go
```

For an example of the go generate argument to use, look at "string_list_example/string_list.go".
